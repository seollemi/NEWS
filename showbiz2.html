                        <p class="card-text">
                            By GMA Integrated News <br>
                            Sandara Park couldn't help but burst into tears when she reunited with her adviser from Grade 6. <br><br>

                            In the latest episode of her vlog series “It’s More Fun with Dara Tour” in the Philippines, the K-Pop idol brought fellow 2NE1 member Minzy to her old neighborhood in Pasay City. They went to the Philippine Pasay Chung Hua Academy, and it was Dara’s first time back in 20 years despite visiting the country often.<br><br>

                            Sandara and Minzy spent some time in a classroom. A few moments later, Dara was surprised when her Grade 6 adviser entered, and she immediately ran to hug her. <br><br>

                            “Sandara, remember me?” Sandara’s class adviser said. <br><br>

                            “Yes, you’re still here!” Sandara answered. <br><br>

                            When the two hugged, Sandara could not help but shed some happy tears.<br><br>

                            Dara’s teacher described Sandara as “very quiet. She was really very, very quiet.” She also said that the K-Pop idol did not even recite in class and would ask her friend to speak for her.<br><br>

                            “But we didn’t know that she would become like this, open up and bloom to this very pretty young lady and a confident lady,” the teacher said.
                            The teacher added that Sandara’s friends and team also helped her become who she is now. <br><br>

                            “She has also kept her values, she is a very fine lady,” she said. <br><br>

                            “I don’t know why she hasn’t gotten married yet!” she teased.<br><br>

                            Dara’s teacher added that she is so proud that Sandara learned how to speak Filipino and be successful in entertainment.<br><br>

                            “I couldn’t imagine that she would be going this far, to sing and dance in front of so many people. When she was here, we cannot make her do it,” she said. “See, people really come out as they grow old. They will spread their wings. And it’s a good thing that she was able to spread her wings really well."<br><br>

                            Minzy also introduced herself to the teacher and told her, “Thank you for taking care of her so much.”<br><br>

                            Sandara and her teacher shared one more hug before leaving. Sandara said her teacher was popular and very sweet back then. Aside from being her adviser, she was also in charge of the choir.<br><br>

                            “When I first expressed my interest, she was like, ‘How? You don’t even talk,’” she said, and added that ever since she joined the choir and performed on stage, the teacher was there for her.<br><br>
